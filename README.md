# TDT4173 Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the TDT4173 Machine Learning repository! This repository contains the work completed for the course TDT4173. The repository is organized into two main folders: **Individual Assignment** and **Machine Learning Project**.

## Individual Assignment

The **Individual Assignment** folder contains the code and documentation for the individual assignment portion of the course.

## Main Project

The **Machine Learning Project** folder represents 100% of the grade for the TDT4173 course. This project was a collaborative effort between Ola Sæther, Simeon Christoffersen, and Olav Finne Præsteng Larsen. The folder includes two notebooks with our best predictions, and a long notebook containing everything we did, including failed attempts, and strategies. The group tried to predict solar power generation every hour in three different solar panels in different locations based on around 40 weather features.
